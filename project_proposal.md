### 1.0 Introduction
##### 1.1 Problem Situation
> Disability is a lack of accessibility defined within societal constructs.
Our environment is not designed in a fashion that is all-inclusive to everyone,
and because of this, those who are different are outcasted and pitied.
Our goal is to see if this is true specifically regarding an opportunity.
The direct stakeholders are those with any type of disability. There are many
values at play when referring to employment or education for those who have
disabilities. People with certain disabilities are refused employment and may
be offered lower wages because of their disability. This ultimately conflicts
with the ethics and values of individuals.

##### 1.2 What is the problem?
> Disability contains a diverse group of people; however, these people are put
into a social positioning where their peers view them as less of a being and
are granted restricted opportunities. Those with disabilities are isolated from the traditional classroom environment which can hinder their education and integration into society following the completion of their studies. This tends to have further implications when those with disabilities are in search of employment with a median salary.

##### 1.3 Why does it matter?
> This issue at hand is highly prevalent because those with disabilities are
typically dehumanized and are granted restricted opportunities compared to
able-bodied individuals to thrive in today’s world. People are instilled to
have the innate predisposition of a one-dimensional outlook towards those with
disabilities, in a way that makes them feel inferior. It is important to be
aware of this and to make change accordingly by being mindful of those with
disabilities and to further provide equal opportunity.

##### 1.4 How will it be addressed?
> Our goal with this project is to gather insight from a large dataset
regarding disability, to gain an understanding of the disparities in
opportunity from those who are able-bodied to those who aren’t. With the insights
gathered from the dataset, we plan to spread awareness of these disparities to
make this clear to individuals to open their mindset and to make a change in
the way we as a society disable individuals from excelling.

### 2.0 Research Questions
##### 2.1 Question 1
With the preceding information being mentioned, our first research question is about the opportunity provided to those with disabilities in education and in the industry: Does disability affect one’s income? Education? Employment?
##### 2.2 Question 2
Moving on, we wanted to dive into a more nuanced topic regarding War Veterans,
and how those who become disabled are then reacclimated and treated society. Specifically, does holding a veteran status affect education or employment?

### 3.0 Possible Datasets
##### 3.1 Dataset 1: American Institute of Research
The first dataset gives detailed information about those with disabilities regarding their eligibility for Social Security Administration (SSA) and the benefits received. This may be beneficial for understanding the demographics of those that have various disabilities.

##### 3.2 Dataset 2: U.S. Department of Labor
Our next possible dataset contains examines the occupational distributions of
those with disabilities in various industries and compares that information with income.

### 4.0 Information Visualizations
##### 4.1 An Uneven Playing Field

_Shows the disparities in the income gap of those with varying educations and
further highlights the gap in the pay between able-bodied people and disabled
people. The visual makes it clear that those with disabilities receive less pay._
##### 4.2 Our Nation's Veterans
![Veteran Status and Location](https://www.census.gov/content/census/en/library/visualizations/2015/comm/our-nation-s-veterans/jcr:content/map.detailitem.950.high.png/1525721650875.png)
_Highlights the distribution on a geographic map of civilian veterans
as well as their period of service. Also provides key details regarding the median income of veterans, demographics of veterans, population, etc._

### 5.0 Team Coordination
In order to complete our project, each team must maintain fluid communication and work ethic. Each week, our team will meet on Saturdays at noon and Sundays as needed to discuss the project and priorities to complete. All our communication will be through Facebook Messenger because of it the easiest form of communication. We will address any challenges regarding work or communication in person, while also being empathetic of each person to mitigate conflict. As the project goes on, we will continually provide feedback to each other at each meeting on Saturday to have a successful deliverable and learning experience. The purpose of this project is to learn about how to manipulate data with a topic in which each individual is interested in:
> **Sahil Unadkat:** _With this project, my goal role is to lead the group and provide deliverables to ensure the project is cohesive. My goal with this project is to understand how to filter data to gain insight._  
**Suyeon Hong:** _My role in this project is to research data and learn how to apply the fundamentals of datascience to find answers to our topic of interest._  
**Siddharth Bedekar:** _My goal with this project is to learn how to manipulate a dataset to provide the necessary information to answer the question at hand. My role will focus more on applying these skills._  
**Salihou Fatty:** _My goal for this project is to gain both soft skills and data science skills by working on a team to work with data and gain insights. My role will revolve around implementing the necessary changes to the data._
### 6.0 Questions for Teaching Team
The biggest question our team has is how do we know we have the right dataset(s)? How many datasets does a project such as this rely on?
